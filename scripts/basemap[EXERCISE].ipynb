        "NOTE: Basemap module is, in theory, deprecated in favor of [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/). However as of today (2021, Oct. 07) cartopy crashes Google Colab. For the sake of better support, we stick to Basemap. Consider that the main concepts are easily adaptable (e.g. you still need to decide what type of projection you want to use).\n",
